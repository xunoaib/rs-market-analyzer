# Runescape Market Analyzer

A Python 3.10+ framework for scraping and analyzing Grand Exchange prices from the Runescape Wiki's [real-time price API](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices).

## Installation

* Install the package in an "editable" form by running `python -m pip install -e .`
* Run the program with the `rsmarket` command

Alternatively, you can skip the installation step and run it from this
directory with `python -m rsmarket <args>`. However, dependencies will first
have to be installed with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
