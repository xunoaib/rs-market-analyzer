pSQL 
    - Split up query
        - Intermediate calculations can go to new statisitcs entity
            - run with/after latest API calls
    - Compare latest to previous latest for significant changes
        - How to deterimine if a change is significant?
            - daily volume?
            - 5m / 1h entities?
            - Solution needs to be easily tweakable
        - Use highprice, lowprice or both?
        - Probably will need a dedicated statistics entity in DB
            -- TODO margin calculation
            -- TODO anticipated/max profit (Limit*margin)
            -- Probably need to grab the timing of the second last high price?
    - 1h volume is wonky. Should fix via column in mapping/new 24hr entity/statistics entity
Python - Create some method to visualize data over time

Ideas for detecting notable price variations:
    Expected value function?
        Probably too dificult. Need to do some research
    Statistically significant movement of latest over fivemin
        Automated filtering using historical data?
