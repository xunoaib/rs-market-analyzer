pSQL - Compare latest to fivemin for significant changes
        - How to deterimine if a change is significant?
            - Solution needs to be easily tweakable
        - Use highprice, lowprice or both?
        - Probably will need a dedicated statistics entity in DB
Python - Create some method to visualize data over time

Ideas for detecting notable price variations:
    Expected value function?
        Probably too dificult. Need to do some research
    Statistically significant movement of latest over fivemin
        Automated filtering using historical data?
